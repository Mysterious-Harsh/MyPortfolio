# Design Style Guide

## Design Philosophy

**Color Palette**: Modern monochromatic with strategic color accents
- Primary: Deep charcoal (#1a1a1a) and pure white (#ffffff)
- Accent: Electric blue (#0066ff) for interactive elements and highlights
- Secondary: Warm gray (#6b7280) for supporting text
- Success: Emerald green (#10b981) for achievements
- Data visualization: Muted tones with saturation below 50%

**Typography**: 
- Display font: "Inter" - Bold, modern sans-serif for headings
- Body font: "Inter" - Clean, readable for content
- Code font: "JetBrains Mono" - Technical precision for code snippets

**Visual Language**: 
- Minimalist aesthetic with purposeful white space
- Grid-based layouts with mathematical precision
- Subtle geometric patterns as background elements
- Clean lines and sharp edges reflecting technical expertise
- Professional yet approachable tone

## Visual Effects

**Used Libraries**:
- Anime.js: Smooth micro-interactions and page transitions
- ECharts.js: Interactive data visualizations and skill charts
- p5.js: Dynamic background particles and creative coding elements
- Typed.js: Typewriter effect for hero text
- Splitting.js: Text animation effects

**Effects & Animations**:
- Typewriter animation for hero text with gradient color cycling
- Subtle particle system background using p5.js
- Smooth scroll-triggered animations with stagger effects
- Interactive hover states with 3D transforms
- Loading animations with progress indicators
- Smooth page transitions with fade and slide effects

**Header Effect**:
- Clean navigation with subtle backdrop blur
- Smooth color transitions on scroll
- Mobile-responsive hamburger menu with smooth animations

**Background Treatment**:
- Consistent dark background throughout
- Subtle geometric grid pattern overlay
- Floating particles that respond to mouse movement
- No section-specific background colors - unified aesthetic

**Interactive Elements**:
- Buttons with subtle glow effects on hover
- Cards that lift with shadow expansion
- Form inputs with animated focus states
- Project cards with smooth scale and overlay transitions
- Timeline elements with connecting line animations

## Styling Approach

**Layout**: 
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
- Container queries for component-level responsiveness
- Consistent spacing using 8px grid system
- Maximum content width of 1200px centered

**Color Usage**:
- Background: Consistent dark theme (#0a0a0a to #1a1a1a gradient)
- Text: High contrast white (#ffffff) for readability
- Interactive elements: Electric blue (#0066ff) with hover states
- Data visualizations: Monochromatic with single accent color

**Component Design**:
- Cards: Dark backgrounds with subtle borders
- Buttons: Solid fills with hover transformations
- Forms: Clean inputs with floating labels
- Navigation: Fixed header with backdrop blur
- Modals: Centered overlays with smooth transitions

This design system creates a cohesive, professional aesthetic that reflects technical expertise while remaining visually engaging and accessible.
